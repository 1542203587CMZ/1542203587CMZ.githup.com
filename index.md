## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/1542203587CMZ/1542203587CMZ.githup.com/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>崔明珠的Gitup</title>
    </head>
    <body style="background-color: lightblue">
        <h1>这是一个一个简单的HTML,h1
            <p>Hello World！</p>
        </h1>
        <h2>这是CMZ的简单网页</h2>
        <h3>内容有待补充</h3>
        <h4>好好学习，天天向上</h4>
        <h4>点击按钮，进入崔明珠的Gitup</h4>
        <button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://github.com/1542203587CMZ/1542203587CMZ.githup.com'">崔明珠的Gitup</button>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/1542203587CMZ/1542203587CMZ.githup.com/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
